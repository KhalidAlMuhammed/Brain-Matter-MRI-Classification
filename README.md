# MRI Classification

## Overview
This Python project is designed to process and analyze MRI images using deep learning to differentiate between white matter, grey matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. The project uses libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn to perform tasks like image resizing, data interpolation, and model training.

## Features
- MRI image loading
- Image preprocessing and resizing
- Data interpolation using SciPy
- Model training with TensorFlow and PyTorch
- Performance evaluation using confusion matrix and accuracy score

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.9 or newer
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- SciPy
- Nibabel
